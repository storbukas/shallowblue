# Shallow Blue Chess AI

Shallow Blue, which name is inspired from the Deep Blue chess computer, is a chess game providing an AI with different levels of difficulty. The AI was part of a contest to compete towards other chess AIs - ending up as the winner.

Shallow Blue uses a Minimax algorithm implementation to calculate the chess heuristic, in order to minimize the possible loss for a worst case (maximum loss) scenario. The Minimax algorithm is significantly enhanced by the use of Alpha-Beta Pruning which eliminates the need to search large portions of the game tree applying a branch-and-bound technique.
