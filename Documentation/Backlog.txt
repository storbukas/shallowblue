Backlog:

- Need to implement all the rules for the peices. Currently we are missing some of the more advanced move such as passant, castling and promotion.

- When a player selects a peice. We would like to light up the board with all the possible locations that peice can move to.

- We would like to implement an advanced AI that can be aware of all the possible moves avalible to it without suffering from the horizon effect.

- We would like to have an AI with 10 different difficulties.

- We would like our AI to be able to sort it's avalible moves in order from strongest to weakest so it knows which moves to stop analysing.

- Need to include a save function to allow a player to save his or her game so they may continue with it later on.

- Need to implement clients requests for peice icons.
